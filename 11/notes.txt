DYNAMIC MEMORY ALLOCATION

it is the way to allocate memory to a data structure during the runtime 

functions to allocate and free the memory dynamiclly

a. malloc() -> memory allocation (02.c , 03.c)

takes the number of bytes to be allocated and returns a pointer of type void 

ptr = (int*)malloc(5*sizeof(int)); 

b. calloc() -> continuous allocation (04.c)

this allocates the memory continouslly

initializes with 0

ptr = (*int)calloc(5, sizeof(int));

c. free() -> (05.c)

we use it to free memory that is allocated using malloc and calloc
free(ptr)


d. realloc() -> re-allocation
