LOOP CONTROL INSTRUCTIONS

they are used to run the repetitive code

1. for loop (01.c)

2. while loop 

3. do while loop

pre increment and post increment (04.c)

infinite loop (05.c) -> never use the infinite loop as it will fill the RAM completely

break statement (09.c) 

this breaks the loop where it is written

continue statement (11.c)

this skips to the next iteration
