ARRAYS

collection of similar data types stored at contiguous memory locations (01.c)

int marks[3]; -> size = int * 3
char name[5]; -> size = char * 5
float price[3]; -> size = flaot * 3

if we will try to store elements more than the size of the array then we will get a runtime error

POINTER ARITHEMATIC

pointer can be incremented and decremented  (04.c)

we can subtract one pointer from another 
we can also compare two pointers

we can only subtract or compare pointers of same data type

ARRAY IS A POINTER 

the name of the array is a pointer which points at the zeroth location of the array (08.c)
