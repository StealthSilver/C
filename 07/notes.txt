ARRAYS

collection of similar data types stored at contiguous memory locations (01.c)

int marks[3]; -> size = int * 3
char name[5]; -> size = char * 5
float price[3]; -> size = flaot * 3

if we will try to store elements more than the size of the array then we will get a runtime error

POINTER ARITHEMATIC

pointer can be incremented and decremented  (04.c)

we can subtract one pointer from another 

we can also compare two pointers

we can only suntract or compare pointers of same data type
