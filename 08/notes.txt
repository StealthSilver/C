STRINGS 

A character array terminated by a 'O' (null character)

null character denotes string transformation (02.c)

string format specifier -> "%s"; (03.c)

* scanf() cannot input multi-word strings with spaces 

Here, get() -> this is outdated,  & puts() come into picture

String using pointer 

char *str = "Hello World" 
Store string in memory & the assigned address in stored in the char pointer 'str


char *str = "Hello World";  // can be reinitialized

char str[] = "Hello World" // cannot be reinitialized
