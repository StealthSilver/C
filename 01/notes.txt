INSTRUCTIONS

they are the the rules which are implemented in a program 

1. type decleration instructions  (a.c)
decleration of the variable before using it 

2. arithmetic instructions (b.c)
all the mathematical instructions 

sum +
diff - 
mul * 
div /
mod % 
to use other mathematical functions we can use the math.h file (c.c)

type conversion (d.c)

int op int -> int 
int op float -> float 
float op float -> float

(e.c)
implicit conversions -> the compiler do these conversions by itself 
while going from float / double to int , the decimals are removed
explicit conevrsions -> they are done by the developer forcefully


operator precedence

* , / , % 
+ , -
=

if the precedence is same then the associavity rule is implemented (L -> R)

3. control instructions 

they can control the flow of the execution of program 

a. sequence control  
b. decision control 
c. loop control 
d. case control  

OPERATORS 

a. arthematic operators -> +, - , * , / , % 
b. relational operators
c. logical operators 
d. bitwise operator 
e. assignment operator
f. ternary operator

relational operators (g.c)

in C there are no booleans flase is represented by 0 and true is represented by 1 , or any non zero integer
== ->  are they equal 
> , >= -> greater than , greater than equal to
< , <= -> less than , less than equal to
!= -> not equlal to

logical operators (h.c)

&& -> AND 
|| -> OR 
! -> NOT

assignment operators (i.c)

=
+=
-=
*=
/=
%=

priority of all the operators 

not -> arthematic -> relational -> logical -> assignment
