INSTRUCTIONS

they are the the rules which are implemented in a program 

1. type decleration instructions  (a.c)
decleration of the variable before using it 

2. arithmetic instructions (b.c)
all the mathematical instructions 

sum +
diff - 
mul * 
div /
mod % 
to use other mathematical functions we can use the math.h file (c.c)

type conversion (d.c)

int op int -> int 
int op float -> float 
float op float -> float

(e.c)
implicit conversions -> the compiler do these conversions by itself
explicit conevrsions -> they are done by the developer forcefully
