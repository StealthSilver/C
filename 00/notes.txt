PROGRAMMING IN C

new file can be created by the extention by .c 


VARIABLES : name of the memory location that stores some data

b.c 

int a = 90;

rules for writing variables
1. Variables are case sensitive
2. 1st character can be _ or alphabet nothing else
3. no comma or blank space can be used in variable name
4. the name of the variables must be meaningful

* for storing a char type of data use single quotes


DATA TYPES 

Char / Signed char -> 1 byte
Unsigned char -> 1 byte
int / signed int -> 2 byte
unsigned int -> 2 byte
short int / unsigned short int -> 2 byte
Signed short int -> 2 byte
Long int / Signed long int -> 4 bytes  
Unsigned long int -> 4 bytes  
float -> 4 bytes 
double -> 8 bytes 
long double -> 10 bytes

there are no boolean types, strings, objects in C 

CONSTANTS 

integer constants -> 1,2,3 
real constants -> 1.3 , 5.4
character constants -> 'a' , 'A' , '@'

KEYWORDS 

there are a few reserved words that cannot be used as the name of the variables
in C there are 32 keywords 

COMMENTS 

single line // this is a single line comment 

multi line /* this is a 
            multi line comment */


OUTPUT IN C 

printf("hello");


format specifiers are used to get the output format 
for int -> %d 
for float -> %f 
for char -> %c
